## Hi, I'm Adam Tetz!

I help businesses run _more efficiently_ by bridging the gap between their
_data_ and the _actions_ they take.

I achieve this in two key ways: 
- First, I _automate processes_ that involve _multiple_ systems, eliminating manual errors, delays and repetitive tasks. This directly _reduces your operating costs and minimises risks_.

- Second, I help gather _clear and actionable insights_ derived from data _across different systems_. This empowers you to _make smarter decisions that improve your organisation's performance_.

### Beyond data
üåç **Adapting to La Vie Fran√ßaise**

Only just emigrated to France in october 2024, I'm adapting to my living my life in Burgundy and currently learning French (A2 and counting!)

‚õ∞Ô∏è **Outdoors**

I love the outdoors! Whether it's Hiking, cycling, motoring or just walking _une promenade_
