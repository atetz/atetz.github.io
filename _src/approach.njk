<h2>What to expect?</h2>
<p>
  Every problem is unique, so it's important to get a clear picture from the
  start. That way, we can adapt our approach to fit your situation.

<h2>Why work with me?</h2>
<p>
  With over 14 years in IT, I've held various roles from sysadmin and
  application management to consultancy. Along the way, I achieved part-time
  degrees in IT service management and IT & business. I enjoy the challenge of a
  good problem, analysing symptoms, identifying what's wrong and finding a
  solution.
</p>
<p>
  Over time, I naturally moved toward data integration work (which I find most
  enjoyable). I believe that the most transformative tech solutions begin with a
  deep understanding of the problem. Thanks to my broad experience, I bring both
  technical and business perspectives to every project. This allows me to
  understand your challenges from multiple angles and deliver solutions that
  stick.
