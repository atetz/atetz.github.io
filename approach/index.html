<h2>What to expect?</h2>
<p>
  Every problem is unique, so it's important to get a clear picture from the
  start. That way, we can adapt our approach to fit your situation.

  <summary role="button" class="outline">Step 1: Intro meeting</summary>
  <p>
    We'll begin with a intro meeting. This is an open conversation about your goals, the challenges you're facing and what you are looking for. We'll explore wether and how we can work together.
    
  </p>
</details>

<hr>
 
<details>
  <summary role="button" class="outline">Step 2: Shared understanding</summary>
  <p>
    If the next step isn't clear yet, we can dive deeper with a <b>Discovery Hackathon</b>* During this hands-on session we'll further explore your goals, challenges, systems & processes together. This also means sketching out solutions or testing assumptions to create a shared understanding. Whether or not we end up working together, you'll walk away with new insights. And I'll be able to make a realistic proposal.
    
    <br>

  <summary role="button" class="outline">Step 6: Iteration &amp; delivery</summary>

  <summary role="button" class="outline">Step 7: Wrapping up &amp; Looking Ahead</summary>
  <p>
    Once I've delivered what we have agreed upon, we'll do a retrospective. From there, we can discuss what next step best fits your needs. We either wrap things up, start a new phase, or move into a support/maintenance phase.

<h2>Why work with me?</h2>
<p>
  With over 14 years in IT, I've held various roles from sysadmin and
  application management to consultancy. Along the way, I achieved part-time
  degrees in IT service management and IT & business. I enjoy the challenge of a
  good problem, analysing symptoms, identifying what's wrong and finding a
  solution.
</p>
<p>
  Over time, I naturally moved toward data integration work (which I find most
  enjoyable). I believe that the most transformative tech solutions begin with a
  deep understanding of the problem. Thanks to my broad experience, I bring both
  technical and business perspectives to every project. This allows me to
  understand your challenges from multiple angles and deliver solutions that
  stick.
