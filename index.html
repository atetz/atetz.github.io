<p><h1>How did I make this page?</h1>
<p>My goal was to make a simple page that would enable me to write something about myself and my services. And it should also be a spot where I could share my ideas. I heard about Github pages before and I wanted to give it a go. Naturally I found loads of resources naming jekyll.</p>
<p>I spun up a repo and tried it out with a simple theme. Soon I noticed that once I wanted to make some changes to the theme, it required some effort to understand and override what the prevous designer intended. Could I just pick something and call it a day? Maybe.</p>
<p>But there was also a feeling lingering. I wanted something more minimalistic....
When I was a teen my &quot;hobby&quot; used to be designing websites. Designing a template in a graphic program, slicing it up in 1px images and using HTML + CSS2.
Nowadays we have HTML5 and CSS3. I heard great stories about grid and flexbox. Which meant the days of fighting divs is long gone..</p>
<p>So I decided I'd roll my own. With the help of some usefull libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>PicoCSS for a nice out of the box CSS that gives me a nice set of defaults to work with</li>
<li>Eleventy as a simpler static site generator so that I can generate content based on md files.</li>
</ul>
</p>
